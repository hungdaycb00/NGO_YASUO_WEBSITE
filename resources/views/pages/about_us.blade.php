                <p>GiveIndia was born on April 28, 2000 out of the belief that equal
                    opportunity is the cornerstone of civilization. All human beings
                    must have the same opportunity to succeed in life, irrespective
                    of the circumstances they were born into.
                </p>
                <p>However, this is far from true. </p>
                <p>Individual wealth in India witnessed a growth rate of 10.91% in the
                    year 2016-17 against 8.50% in 2015-16 . India also created higher
                    number of high-net-worth-individuals with a growth rate of 9.5%
                    against the Asia growth rate of 7.5%
                </p>
                <p>
                    And yet, 36% of children under 5 in India are malnourished,
                    51 per cent of the women of reproductive age suffer from anemia
                    , 33 million children still do not attend school and employed in
                    various forms of child labor, 350 million Indians still face the
                    burden of open defecation due to lack of access to sanitation facilities,
                    and close to 18,000 villages in India still do not have storage facilities for water.
                </p>
                <p>We at GiveIndia, aspire to change this inequality.</p>
                <p>
                    We do that by bringing together the people who want to give and the
                    organizations that work to make a difference.
                </p>

                    <h4 class="boote">
                        “ The idea of GiveIndia was born very simply to bridge the
                        gap between two sets of people - people who want to give,
                        who want to try and make a difference along with those who
                        are doing phenomenal work but don’t know how to reach out
                        to the people who want to support them. ”

                    The consequences of poverty are manifold and it impacts families through
                    generations. An intervention at the right time, like educating one generation
                    or providing livelihood to increase income can help families break the cycle of
                    generational poverty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    India is population rich. Our people are our resources and if each one of us
                    commits to <b>giving regularly</b>, we will be strong enough to solve our problems.
                    We could even be audacious enough to say that we as a community may not need any aid
                    if we make giving a way of life.
